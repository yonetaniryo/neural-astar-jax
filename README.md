# Faster Neural A\* Implemented in Jax

This is a third-party implementation of [Neural A\* search [Yonetani+, ICML 2021]](https://github.com/omron-sinicx/neural-astar/).
The implementation is under active development; the quantitative performances are still limited due to potential bugs or differences between PyTorch and Jax.
